                <p>Hi, I am Joe Ng. Basically, I feel that NUSPlan has the capability to help every student in their module planning process and selection.
                It helps every student to have a better control of their studying life and to prepare themselves for other future module planning in terms of exchange or even NOC.
                This idea came about as both of us(the founders) often faced with similar problem, often changing our module preferences to suit each other. One change has to lead to many
                changes and it gets messier and messier and we ended up feeling frustrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                Join us on NUSPlan to explore the capabilites that it offers as we add on the many features or even enhancing the existing features! (:
